Obviously it is trivial to cheat in this game using the console. So, this code is about trying to figure out the optimal strategy using,
The 'rules' are, you are allowed to perform one action every 250ms ( eg 4 clicks a second ), you are not allowed to modify the game other than by doiing something a human user would be able to.

Current Strategy
1) if there is a golden cookie click it
2) if there is an upgrade that has higher 'value' than base_value and we can afford it - buy it
3) find the object with the best value (best_value)
	3a) if we can afford best_value - buy it ( store the value in base_value )
	3b) if there is a different object that we can purchase that will pay itself back before the time taken to buy best_value - buy it 
4) click the big cookie


Appendix

price - cost ( in cookies ) of purchasing an item
cps - number ( in cookies per second ), refers to the amount of global cps gained by purchasing an upgrade
value - time (in seconds) the time taken to repay the cost of purchasing an item  ( = price / cps );
time_to_buy - number ( in seconds ) the time until we can afford to buy an item based on current cookies and global cps
best_value - item that has the highest 'value'
base_value - value of the last best_object purchased
