Obviously it is trivial to cheat in this game using the console. So, this code is about trying to figure out the optimal strategy without 'cheating'. The code perform one action every 250ms ( eg 4 clicks a second ), you are not allowed to modify the game other than by doing something a human user would be able to.

Current Strategy
1) if there is a golden cookie click it
2) create an array of all objects and upgrades ( calculating price, cps and value for each )
	2a) if we can afford best_value - buy it
	2b) if there is a different object that we can purchase that will pay itself back before the time taken to buy best_value - buy it 
3) otherwise click the big cookie


Appendix

price - cost ( in cookies ) of purchasing an item
cps - number ( in cookies per second ), refers to the amount of global cps gained by purchasing an upgrade
value - time (in seconds) the time taken to repay the cost of purchasing an item  ( = price / cps );
time_to_buy - number ( in seconds ) the time until we can afford to buy an item based on current cookies and global cps
best_value - item that has the highest 'value'
